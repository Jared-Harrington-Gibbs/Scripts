# Scripts Overview
This is a bunch of scripts or cool things I've encourntered over time.  
If a script/tutorial/MS article/one-liner catches my fancy I'll usually grab a copy and refactor it to include some nice new features.  
If I took something the original sources should be credited in the initial commit message.  
I haven't really been uploading much so I thought it's about time to add some stuff here that I've gathered over time.  
This repo will be organized and refactored many times (probably).
